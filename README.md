# KNN Algorithm


##### This is python code for the KNN algorithm, a traditional machine learning tool for supervised-learning (both classification and regression tasks).




#### The main object of this project is to write a KNN algorithm without using usual libraries, in particular, scikit-learn and other prepared tools.



### Dataset:

A small dataset with 100 records and three features for a classification task. Its thrird feature determines the class and label of the record which is either 0 or 1.
